# LED poi

This is some code for a [poi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_(performance_art)). To see what is possible, take a look [at this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGy0neDXxAE0) for example.

As of this writing, I have built two of these: one with a GT82C_02 board inside and one with a GT832E_01 board (both Nordic chips). These boards are easy to solder, are very small and only require a single external component (a voltage regulator) to run them. It is very loosely based on [this build](http://orchardelica.com/wp/?page_id=597).
